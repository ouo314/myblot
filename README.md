My inspiration comes from this piece (https://blot.hackclub.com/editor?src=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hackclub/blot/main/art/2DLight-Will/index.js). My first thought was that it seemed to be blocking the light coming from the center, so I thought I could create an opposite workâ€”one that enhances the energy coming from the center. My theme is water wave diffraction. When water waves pass through a slit, they create diffraction, which adds curves to the originally uniform parallel waves. I added lines perpendicular to the wavefront to enhance the sense of radiation.
